# Full-Data-Analyzing-Excel-projects
Here I add full project using Excel
1. In link below I have a data set about bike customers from a bike store. the question is, what type of customers are more likely to buy a bike.
   So I am going to take a look at the data set, and starting cleaning data as I think about what information are important for getting desired answer to our main question.
   * one of cleaning step I really liked is that i observed the age column is too diverse, and I thought if I want to see how is the relation between the buyer and his age, then it would be a real mess to live it like this. so I used nested of function IF, and added new culomn named Age Category, which is clearer in case we wnt to visualise with a chart. you can see the progect here in the link bellow:(it is an excel link with number of sheets. the bike_buyer sheet is my raw data, working sheet is the cleaned data, pivot table sheet for summarizing and see the relations, and visualizing and the dashbourd sheet)
