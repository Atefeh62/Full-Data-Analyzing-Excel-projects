# Full-Data-Analyzing-Excel-projects
Here I add full project using Excel
1. In link below I have a data set about bike customers from a bike store. the question is, what type of customers are more likely to buy a bike.
   So I am going to take a look at the data set, and starting cleaning data as I think about what information are important for getting desired answer to our main question.
   * one of cleaning step I really liked is that i observed the age column is too diverse, and I thought if I want to see how is the relation between the buyer and his age, then it would be a real mess to live it like this. so I used nested of function IF, and added new culomn named Age Category, which is clearer in case we wnt to visualise with a chart. you can see the progect here in the link bellow:(it is an excel link with number of sheets. the bike_buyer sheet is my raw data, working sheet is the cleaned data, pivot table sheet for summarizing and see the relations, and visualizing and the dashbourd sheet, the rest of the sheets are from analyzing the data of the customers who haven't bought bicycle, I filtered the data for only data from the customers who have no in column purchase, then I also obserevd the middle aged customers are a big society target so I analyze this category, also mae a new column with income category to visualize clearer)
